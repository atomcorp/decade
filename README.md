This is a little site with my favourite songs of the decade. The data comes from Spotify playlists. Currently is looks very boring, I've lost interest in doing anything but making it alive at this point ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

It has a node script that grabbed the data. It's typescript and react, otherwise.
