# 2010s

[Visit site at https://atomcorp.github.io/decade/](https://atomcorp.github.io/decade/)

This is a little site with my favourite songs of the decade. The data comes from Spotify playlists. Currently is looks very boring, I've lost interest in doing anything but making it alive at this point ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

It has a node script that grabbed the data. It's typescript and react, otherwise.

#### Todo

- Make it look fun
- Provide some info about it
- Fix routing issues using gh-pages (press refresh on a non-root route)
